The new SensorTag includes 10 low-power MEMS sensors in a tiny red package. And it is expandable with DevPacks to make it easy to add your own sensors or actuators. <br><br>The SensorTag is supported by CCS Cloud together with <a target='_blank' href='http://www.ti.com/tool/cc-devpack-debug'>Debug DevPack</a>. Connect the Debug DevPack and compile the SensorTag firmware with CCS Cloud and start experimenting with your own SensorTag firmware without installing any development tools.<br><br>Connect to the cloud with Bluetooth&reg; Smart and get your sensor data online in 3 minutes. The SensorTag is ready to use right out the box with an iOS and Android app, with no programming experience required to get started.<br><br>The new SensorTag is based on the CC2650 wireless MCU, offering 75% lower power consumption than previous Bluetooth Smart products. This allows the SensorTag to be battery powered, and offer years of battery lifetime from a single coin cell battery.",
