						<h4>Congratulations on choosing the CC1350 Wireless MCU and LaunchPad ecosystem!</h4>
						<p>The CC1350 LaunchPad is TI’s first dual-band kit utilizing the CC1350 which enables Sub-1GHz + BLE in a single chip solution. This new LaunchPad kit brings easy and low cost sub-1GHz proprietary RF connections to the LaunchPad ecosystem with the SimpleLink ultra-low power CC13xx family of devices. This LaunchPad kit brings support for the <a href="http://www.ti.com/product/cc1350">CC1350 wireless MCU</a></p>
						<p>The CC1350 device is a wireless MCU featuring sub-1GHz RF GFSK, Long Range Mode (LRM, a direct sequence spread spectrum modulation format), and other sub-1GHz modulations - in addition it supports 2.4GHz RF! The CC1350 device contains a 32-bit ARM&reg; Cortex&reg;-M3 processor that runs at 48 MHz as the main processor and a rich peripheral feature set that includes a unique ultra-low power sensor controller. This sensor controller is ideal for interfacing external sensors and for collecting analog and digital data autonomously while the rest of the system is in sleep mode.</p>
						<p>The CC1350 LaunchPad is supported by a large set of software examples in the <a href="http://software-dl.ti.com/dsps/dsps_public_sw/sdo_sb/targetcontent/tirtos/index.html">TI-RTOS CC13xx/CC26xx SDK</a>, showing best practice on how to implement and use different features of the CC1350. An overview for the software examples can be found on <a href="http://www.ti.com/tool/cc13xx-sw">this web page</a>. The CC1350 is also supported by the <a href="http://ti.com/ble-stack"> TI BLE software stack</a>, which enables full BLE connectivity.</p>

						<h4>CC1350 LaunchPad Out of the Box Introduction</h4>
						<p>The CC1350 LaunchPad is pre-programmed with the TI BLE stack, allowing you to connect to the device using e.g. the SensorTag iOS/Android smartphone app.
						When connected the cc1350 device offers the same functionality as e.g. the cc2650 Launchpad. Using the built in BLE Over the Air Download (OAD) one can easily convert
					  the CC1350 device from a BLE device into e.g. a sub-1GHz device, due to the dual mode capabilites of the CC1350. In this step by step guide we will show
						you how to download new application images to create a small wireless sensor network. The sensor network includes a concentrator that receives sub-1GHz data and
						Nodes that send data over the sub-1GHz link to the concentrator and in addition reconfigures the radio core on the fly to send out BLE advertisement packets.
						A high level overview of the complete demo is shown in the picture below.</p>
						<p><img border=0 width=625 height=468 id="Picture 3" src="images/nwk.PNG"></p>

										<div class="primary">A node spends most of the time in standby to ensure lowest possible power consumption. It samples the ADC sensor once every second using the Sensor Controller.
											The node then sends its sensor data to the concentrator over sub-1GHz (50kbps, GFSK) link. The sensor data is; ADC value, battery level, time since last reboot, number of packets sent and the button state (BTN-1).
											The Node then reconfigures the radio into BLE mode and send out BLE beacons, aften this the node enter standby until it is time to read the ADC again.</div>

									</div>
								</div>
							</iron-list>
							Both the Node and Concentrator can be configured to send out BLE advertisement packets, this is done by pressing BTN-2. The supported BLE advertisement formats are:
							<br>
							1. Manufacturer Specific (MS) + Eddystone URL, this mode can be used with the TI SensorTag app and any app that supports Eddystone. This is the default mode for Node.<br>
							2. Manufacturer Specific (MS).<br>
							3. Google Eddystone URL + TLM (interleaved), Google's Open Source BLE beacon format which can be used with any Eddystone compatible app.<br>
							4. Google Eddystone UID + TLM (interleaved)<br>
							5. None. This is the default for Concentrator.
						</div>
						<h4>Pre-work</h4>
						Rev 1.1 of the CC1350 LaunchPad contains a pre-production factory image. Please update to the latest image by connecting the LaunchPad to your PC and pressing the button below (in a Chrome browser window). 
						The first time you do this, a small flash utility will need to be installed locally on your PC. After reprogramming your device you may need to reset it by pressing the reset button on your launchpad.

						<h5>Node details</h5>
						-Press BTN-1 on Node. The button state is sent out both in the data payload for the sub-1GHz interface and in a BLE beacon.<br>
						-BTN-1 also starts a fast (1s interval) report interval that lasts 30s.<br>
						-The Node sends BLE beacons that can be picked up by any BLE capable device.<br>
						-By default the Node is sending BLE beacons with Eddystone URL + MS (prop) frame format. Press BTN-2 to toggle between supported BLE beacon formats, as described above.<br>
						<h5>Concentrator details</h5>
						-The Concentrator can also be configured to send BLE beacons, similar to Nodes. Use BTN-2 to cycle through beacon types.<br>
						-The BLE beacon payload is forwarded from a selected Node forming a bridge between the sub-1GHz and BLE interfaces.<br>
						-The ‘*’ next to the Node on Concentrator’s LCD/UART indicate which Node’s data is being used to send the BLE beacon. BTN-1 on the Concentrator is used to cycle through Nodes when multiple nodes are connected.<br><br>

						<h4>Getting back to BLE stack/app mode</h4>
						It is possible to get back to BLE stack/app mode, running the full BLE stack, by pressing both buttons down for 10s. The device will then restart in BLE mode, indicated by green LED blinking.<br>
						Alternatively, you can use the flashing button above to re-flash the factory image.

					<h4>Power supply requirements:</h4>
					<p>The LaunchPad is designed to be powered from a USB-compliant
					power source, either a USB charger or a computer. When used this way, jumpers
					need to be mounted on the 3V3 position of the central jumper block. An LDO
					powered from the USB VBUS supply supplies 3.3V to the XDS debugger, the CC1350,
					and associated circuitry including the 3V3-marked pins for BoosterPacks.</p>
					<h4>Temperature range:</h4>
					<p>The LaunchPad is designed for operation -25 to +70 C. Note
					that other BoosterPacks and LaunchPads may have different temperature ranges,
					and when combined, the combination will be set by the most restrictive combined
					range.</p>
				</div>
		</paper-card>
				<paper-card heading="Advanced use of the LaunchPad hardware" elevation="0">
					<div class="card-content">
						<h4>Jumper block</h4>

						<p>The jumper block in the middle of the board can be used to
						disconnect the upper section (XDS110 debugger) from the bottom section
						(CC1350). The jumpers are mounted by default. If you want to debug the CC1350
						from an external debugger, you need to remove all the jumpers and connect the
						debugger to the socket marked CC1350 In. </p>

						<p>It is also possible to use the CC1350 LaunchPad to debug external
						targets. In this case, remove all the jumpers and connect the external target
						to the socket marked XDS110 Out.</p>

						<p>The jumper block marked VSENSE can be used to select the
						source of power to the CC1350. Usually, power is supplied from USB and a jumper
						is mounted in the position marked XDS110 power (factory default). If you want
						to power CC1350 from an external supply, move the jumper to the position marked
						<i>Extern. Pwr</i>, and connect the external supply to the 3V3 pin on J1. Also
						make sure to remove the 3V3 jumper from the main jumper block. Make sure that
						the voltage applied stays within the supply range of the CC1350.</p>
