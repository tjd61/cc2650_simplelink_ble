        "description": "TI-RTOS accelerates development schedules by eliminating the need to create basic system software functions from scratch. TI-RTOS scales from a real-time multitasking kernel - TI-RTOS Kernel (formerly known as SYS/BIOS) - to a complete RTOS solution including additional middleware components, device drivers and power management. The combination of TI-RTOS power management and TI's ultra low-power MCUs enables developers to design applications with much longer battery life. By providing essential system software components pre-tested and pre-integrated, TI-RTOS enables developers to focus on differentiating their application."
