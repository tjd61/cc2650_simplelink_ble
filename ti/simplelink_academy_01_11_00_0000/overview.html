Introduction
=============

This is an overview file for the SimpleLink Academy workshops. Below you can find links to the individual lab instructions.

The projects and instructions can also be found by opening Resource Explorer inside Code Composer Studio when the SimpleLink Academy installer is finished. You may need to restart CCS to see the new contents.

Some of the dynamic content in the instructions will only function correctly when viewed inside Code Composer Studio's Resource Explorer, with Chrome or with Firefox.

Getting started
============
<span id="downloadLink"></span>

Every lab assignment will tell you what you need to do and install, but [Code Composer Studio `6.1.3+`](http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Download_CCS) must in any case be installed to do the code assignments.

It is also recommended to install the latest [TI BLE SDK v2.x](http://www.ti.com/ble-stack) as that also includes a compatible TI-RTOS package.

[[b! Use Resource Explorer 'Classic' for SimpleLink Academy material
If you are using Code Composer Studio 6.2.x it is necessary to use the 'Classic' version of Resource Explorer to view the training material and import the projects.
