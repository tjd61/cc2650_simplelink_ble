<title> Sensor Controller I2C Light Sensor Project</title>

<xmp theme="united2" style="display:none;" class="col-xs-6">

This project assumes that the I2C Light Sensor Project, generated by Sensor Controller Studio (SCS), is created here: `C:\ti\scs_academy\i2c_light_sensor`. In Sensor Controller Studio (SCS) set `C:\ti\scs_academy` as the project base output directory and the project files will be spawned into the given path.


File import
================
All the project files are linked to from `C:\ti\scs_academy\i2c_light_sensor`. This means that changes done to the project source files will be reflected to the linked to source files. The files in the projects are linked from the file system directly have the following icon with a tiny arrow:
![LinkFile](../../../web_support/resources/linked_file_zoomed.png)

Any changes done to these files are reflected in all projects that use these files. This project is only used


File | Description | Origin
--- | ---------
main_tirtos.c | Initialize IOs,  create TI-RTOS tasks. | Application example source file
scif.c | Sensor Controller Driver | Generated by SCS
scif.h | Sensor Controller Driver  | Generated by SCS
scif_framework.c | Sensor Controller Driver Framework | Generated by SCS
scif_framework.h | Sensor Controller Driver Framework | Generated by SCS
scif_osal_tirtos.c | Sensor Controller OSAL layer | Generated by SCS
scif_osal_tirtos.c | Sensor Controller OSAL layer | Generated by SCS
rom.cfg | TI-RTOS configuration file. | TI-RTOS configuration file

Note that when the TI-RTOS configuration file is in the workspace, the generated output from XDC-tools (TI-RTOS kernel configuration, etc.) will also be placed in the workspace.
